# Hi there üëã
Hello, my name is Marcos, I'm a technology enthusiast and I work as a fullstack developer. My first contact with programming was 5 years ago, but I've been working professionally for 2 and a half years. During this time I've developed games, websites and applications in general.

# Expertise üöÄ
I began my journey as a developer in the front-end world, starting with personal projects such as redesigning pages that I found aesthetically unappealing. As I did freelance work, I realized that being a front-end developer goes beyond aesthetics, more specifically in terms of the web, I focused on developing other qualities such as improving performance, UI and UX and using minimal and native resources.

Throughout my career I've developed an interest in understanding the background of applications, I started with personal projects, some freelance work and then in my company I was migrated to the position of fullstack, which was a great opportunity for me, I currently work using C#, a language that I have a great appreciation for.

Other stacks that I have developed and have been improving are the UI/UX part to evaluate design and a good user experience, the architecture and project structuring part seeking better application performance and now I have been focusing on data cloud and AI to analyze trends and patterns, seeking to improve applications.
